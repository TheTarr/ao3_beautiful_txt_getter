Ao3 beautiful txt getter

---------

quick start:

I'm windows -> download ao3_beautiful_txt_getter.exe, double click to execute!

The downloaded txt file will be save in the same directory alone with your exe file. Please ignore the error.log.

If you encountered any problem, please shoot an issue with whatever in your error.log file.

Please start the project if you find it useful~ THX a lot~

太长不看版：

我是 windows -> 下载 ao3_beautiful_txt_getter.exe，双击运行。

下载好的 txt 会和 exe 放在一个目录。还有个 error.log 不用管。

遇到问题请发起 issue，把 error.log 这个文件的内容贴一下。

如果觉得有用可不可以star一下，谢谢这位陌生人（行大礼）
